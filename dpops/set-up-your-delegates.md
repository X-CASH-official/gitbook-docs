# Register Delegate

## Introduction

Once you have correctly [set up your instance](server-setup.md), installed the different programs, either from the [installer script](installation-process/#quick-installation) or [manually](installation-process/#manual-installation), you can now register as a delegate of the X-Cash Public Network.  
You will need to have all the services already running to generate the necessary parameters to register yourself as a delegate.
