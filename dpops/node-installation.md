# Node Program Installation

## Introduction

{% hint style="info" %}
This guide is assuming that you have already followed the step of the [server setup guide](server-setup.md), or that you are comfortable and knowledgeable about your Linux instance.
{% endhint %}

This guide will walk you through installing, registering, and preparing a delegate node on your instance. Whether you are experienced in Linux or completely new to it, you will be able, at the end of the guide, to have your delegate node running and start securing the X-Cash public network \(provided you get elected as a delegate üòâ\).

The `xcash-dpops` program is used to manage the block validation, communicate with the other delegates and forge blocks. It has also been designed to automatically retribute the voters of their shares.  

## Requirements

### System Requirements

{% hint style="info" %}
In the first beta version, X-Cash's DPoPS will only run on a Linux/Unix OS. **We recommend installing it on a Ubuntu VPS/dedicated server \(18.04\) for the best compatibility.**
{% endhint %}

The delegate node will need to transit a lot of information, notably messages to the other delegates to verify the block information, As time goes by, the features and information that the delegates handle will increase \(notably when the X-Cash Foundation will add **token creation**, **NFT**, **sidechains**, **smart contracts,** and other exciting features ‚≠ê\).

{% hint style="info" %}
The recommended system requirement is designed to be **future-development proof**, meaning that a hardware update should never be needed and still comfortably handle the **`xcash-dpops`** program.
{% endhint %}

|  | **Minimum** | **Recommended** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OS** | Ubuntu 18.04 | Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 |
| **CPU** | 4 threads, 2.0 GHz or more per thread | 4 threads, 2.0 GHz or more per thread |
| **RAM** | 6GB | 32GB |
| **Hard Drive** | 50GB | 2TB |
| **Bandwidth Transfer** | 100GB per month | 500GB per month |
| **Bandwidth Speed** | 100 Mbps | 500 Mbps |

{% hint style="info" %}
It is estimated that the blockchain and decentralized database size will increase by **9GB per year.** 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The **minimum requirements** will suffice at the inception of the new consensus. However, as new features are brought to the program and the blockchain, hardware updates will be needed.
{% endhint %}

### Dependencies

{% hint style="info" %}
The dependencies will be automatically installed and updated with the installation script.
{% endhint %}

The following table summarizes the tools and libraries required to run **`xcash-dpops`** program.

| Dependencies | Min. version | Ubuntu package |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GCC** | 4.7.3 | `build-essential` |
| **CMake** | 3.0.0 | `cmake` |
| **pkg**-**config** | any | `pkg-config` |
| **OpenSSL** | any | `libssl-dev` |
| **Git** | any | `git` |
| **MongoDB** | 4.0.3 | Install from [binaries](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community) |
| **MongoDB C Driver** \(includes BSON library\) | 1.13.1 | Build from [source](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-c-driver/releases/) |
| **xcash-core** | Latest version | [download the latest release](https://github.com/X-CASH-official/X-CASH/releases) or [build from source](https://github.com/X-CASH-official/X-CASH#compiling-x-cash-from-source) |

### Time Synchronization

The **`xcash-dpops`** program uses the system time to calibrate itself and get the signal to send and receive data. It is important that the system time is accurate, otherwise, the program will not work as intended.

To check your system time, use the following command, and verify that the setting `System clock synchronization: yes`

```bash
timedatectl
```

If it says `no`, run the following command:

```bash
timedatectl set-ntp true
systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
```

## Installation

### Installer Script

The **Installer Script** has been designed to easily interact with the **`xcash-dpops`** program and provide easy steps for installation and updates. You can also use this script to restart the programs if you are not comfortable with the command-line interface.

To run the latest version of the installer script, run the following command that will fetch the **`autoinstaller.sh`** script from the official [xcash-dpops](https://github.com/X-CASH-official/xcash-dpops) repository:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X-CASH-official/xcash-dpops/master/scripts/autoinstaller/autoinstaller.sh)"
```

 You will be prompted with the installer menu of the `xcash-dpops` program:

The installation script enables you to install and manage your `xcash-dpops` program easily.  

### Installing the X-Cash DPoPS program

Once you have prepared your Linux instance by following the [server setup guide](server-setup.md), you can run the installer script to easily install, build and configure the node, as well as download the blockchain.

**`xcash-dpops`** is the program needed to run and manage a delegate node. It is responsible for sending messages to the other delegates, organize the consensus, relay and forge new blocks, etc...

To start the installation process, run the latest version of the **`autoinstaller.sh`** script:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/X-CASH-official/xcash-dpops/master/scripts/autoinstaller/autoinstaller.sh)"
```

Choose **`Install`** \(1\) in the `X-Cash DPoPS Installation Settings` section and press **`ENTER`**

#### Installation Directories

You will be prompted to choose different installation directories for:

* The xcash-dpops program
* The blockchain directory
* The delegate database

We **very highly** recommend using the default locations, as several update and installation programs are referencing to these paths. 

#### Solo or shared delegate node

You will be then asked if you want to install the **`xcash-dpops`** program as a **shared delegate** or a **solo delegate**.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the X-Cash Public Network consensus, the delegates are voted into the top position using the XCASH cryptocurrency.  
In some cases, a delegate who owns a large amount of XCASH could become a delegate by himself, without anyone voting for him/her. We are calling them **solo delegate**.  
Solo delegates do not need to set up fees and minimum payout threshold as there is no need to redistribute the reward.
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

Press `ENTER` for the default setting \(`shared delegate`\), or type `No` for `solo delegate`.

If you choose to install the program as a shared delegate, you will need to set up your delegate fees and the minimum payment amount.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%287%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
The **shared delegate fee** is the percentage of fees that are taken from the reward and kept by the delegate. It can be used to pay for the server hosting, to finance projects in the X-Cash ecosystem, etc..
{% endhint %}

Type in your desired delegate fee **in % with up to 6 decimals**.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **`xcash-dpops`** program will handle automatically the payment of the voters with a dedicated **delegate pool website**.  
The shared delegate **minimum payment amount** is the minimal amount of XCASH to be sent periodically to the delegate's voters.
{% endhint %}

Type your desired minimum payment amount \(minimum: 10000 XCASH, maximum: 10M XCASH\) as a whole number.

The script will now ask you if you want to create a wallet to collect the block rewards.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

Press **`ENTER`** for the default setting \(**`YES`**\), or type **`No`**.

If you say **`YES`**, the installer will then ask you if you want to automatically generate a password for the wallet or provide a custom one. Press **`ENTER`** for the default setting \(**`YES`**\), or type **`No`** to provide a custom password.

You will then be asked if you want to create a new block verifier secret key, or import an existing one:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2818%29.png)

Type **`I`** to import your secret key, or **`C`** to create a new one.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Block Verifier Key** is used by the delegates to sign messages when interacting with the network.  
If it's your first install and you don't have one, choose **`Create`** \(**`C`**\) to automatically generate a new one.
{% endhint %}

This would be the last setting to provide. Once every steps have been followed, the settings will be summarized as below and the installation will start:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2815%29.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your wallet password will be displayed again at the end of the installation process. It is however a good idea to save it now.
{% endhint %}

The script will then install automatically the different programs and dependencies needed for the **`xcash-dpops`** program.

{% hint style="info" %}
The installation script will follow automatically the next step of installation. Some of these steps **might take a while.**  
Indeed, the script will download the blockchain \(`~16GB as of 01/06/2020`\), create a new wallet and synchronize it.  
Depending on your server connection and specifications this could take up to several hours.
{% endhint %}

![Screencap of all the steps of the installer script](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2810%29.png)

Once the script has installed everything, you will be prompted with your **X-Cash Delegate wallet data**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2812%29.png)

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Make sure to copy this information in a secure place,** as this is the wallet that will receive the block reward. You will need the block verifiers key to **register yourself as a delegate**.  
Losing this information _will_ result in a loss of funds.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, the wallet is named **`delegate-wallet`** and is stored in **`/root/xcash-official/xcash-wallets/`**
{% endhint %}

Now that the program is installed, your delegate wallet initialized, and the different services running, you can go register yourself as a delegate. Follow the [register delegate](register-delegate.md) guide to continue the node setup.
