# Register Delegate

## Introduction

Once you have correctly [set up your instance](server-setup.md), installed the different programs, you can now register as a delegate of the X-Cash Public Network.  
You will need to have all the services already running to generate the necessary parameters to register yourself as a delegate.

## 1. Register Yourself as a Delegate

You should have noted your block verifier keys during the [program installation](node-installation.md). You will need to prepare a **delegate name**, your **server IP address** or **domain name**, and the **block verifier public key.** Furthermore, you will have to register from the wallet you will be used to collect the reward.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Chose your delegate name wisely as you won't be able to change it down the line. If you want to change the name, you will have to generate a new block verifier key pair and register yourself again, but **you will however lose your previous delegate stats.**
{% endhint %}

First of all, the wallet service should be running in the background. Stop it by using the command:

```text
systemctl stop xcash-rpc-wallet
```

Open and let synchronize your wallet generated during the node installation, either when using the [auto-installer](node-installation.md#quick-installation) or [created manually](node-installation.md#generate-a-wallet).

```text
~/xcash-official/xcash-core/build/release/bin/xcash-wallet-cli --wallet-file ~/xcash-official/xcash-wallets/<WALLET_NAME>
```

Replace the **`<WALLET_NAME>`** with your own.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you installed with the auto-installer script, the wallet name will be **`delegate-wallet`**
{% endhint %}

Once your wallet is fully synchronized, you can use the **`delegate_register`** command with the following parameters:

```text
delegate_register <delegate_name> <IP_address|domain_name> <block_verifier_public_key>
```

And replace the information with:

* **`<delegate_name>`**: the name that will be displayed on the delegate explorer. _Cannot be updated._
* **`<IP_address|domain_name>`** : your server's IP address or its domain name \(if you have bought a domain name and correctly set up the DNS record\). It is recommended to register your delegate using your domain name, as you can redirect your server IP address to it easily in your DNS record, enabling you to change server in the future.  It is however possible to change this information at a later time. _Can be updated._
* **`<block_verifier_public_key>`** : the block verifier public key that you have generated [earlier](register-delegate.md#1-generate-a-block-verifier-key). _Cannot be updated._ 

**Example:**

```text
delegate_register my_delegate my_delegate.domain.com cf8718d638ce0a831f3538ea60d1e27c3a258c7004a1ad7c547cc5331de7d9d7
```

You will be prompted to wait for the next valid data interval. Once your request has been accepted, you will receive the message **`The delegate has been registered successfully`**.

You can check in the [delegates explorer](http://delegates.xcash.foundation/) if your node is correctly appearing.

You can **`exit`** the wallet, and restart the wallet service:

```text
systemctl restart xcash-rpc-wallet
```

## 2. Update Public Information

Each registered delegates will be displayed in the [delegates explorer](http://delegates.xcash.foundation/), along with their statistics and information. At registration, the minimum information that is displayed is your **delegate name** and **IP address**. You can add additional instructions to help others identify you or rally to your cause and vote for you.

First of all, the wallet service should be running in the background. Stop it by using the command:

```text
systemctl stop xcash-rpc-wallet
```

Open and let synchronize the wallet you used to register as a delegate, either when using the [auto-installer](node-installation.md#quick-installation) or [created manually](node-installation.md#generate-a-wallet).

```text
~/xcash-official/xcash-core/build/release/bin/xcash-wallet-cli --wallet-file ~/xcash-official/xcash-wallets/<WALLET_NAME>
```

Replace the **`<WALLET_NAME>`** with your own.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you installed with the autoinstaller script, the wallet name will be **`delegate-wallet`**
{% endhint %}

Once your wallet is fully synchronized, you can use the **`delegate_update`** command with the following parameters:

```text
delegate_update <item> <value>
```

Replace the `<item>` with one of the lists below, and change the corresponding `<value>`

```text
systemctl start xcash-rpc-wallet
