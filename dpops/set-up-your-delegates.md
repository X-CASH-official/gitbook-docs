# Register Delegate

## Introduction

Once you have correctly [set up your instance](server-setup.md), installed the different programs, either from the [installer script](installation-process/#quick-installation) or [manually](installation-process/#manual-installation), you can now register as a delegate of the X-Cash Public Network.  
You will need to have all the services already running to generate the necessary parameters to register yourself as a delegate. 

## 1. Generate a Block Verifier Key

The **block verifier key** is a unique identifier generated by a delegate, and is used in the consensus process to sign messages and verify information. As a delegate, you will need to generate a **block verifier key** before being able to register yourself in the system.

First of all, stop the current running process of the `xcash-dpops` program.

```text
systemctl stop XCASH_DPOPS
```

Then, run the `xcash-dpops` program with the `--generate_key` option. The program is located into the `xcash-dpops/build` folder. Run the command: 

```text
~/xcash-official/xcash-dpops/build/XCASH_DPOPS --generate_key
```

You will be given a **public key** and **private key**.

{% code title="Block Verifier Key" %}
```text
XCASH DPOPS - Version 1.0.0
---------------------------
Public Key:
cf8718d638ce0a831f3538ea60d1e27c3a258c7004a1ad7c547cc5331de7d9d7
Secret Key:
ca1319431124f55fa0d9e0fcc84edd780f80da7d91f08d334fac17c803934ecccf8718d638ce0a831f3538ea60d1e27c3a258c7004a1ad7c547cc5331de7d9d7
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Securely save the key you will be using!** Once you have registered as a delegate with this key pair,  you will be identified in the system with this it.   
If you lose it, you will lose your delegate stats and will have to start over.
{% endhint %}

## 2. Register Yourself as a Delegate

Now that you have generate your block verifier key pair, you can register yourself as a delegate. You will need to prepare a **delegate name**, your **server IP address** or **domain name**, and the **block verifier public key.** Furthermore, you will have to register from the wallet you will be using to collect reward.  ****

{% hint style="warning" %}
Chose your delegate name wisely as you won't be able to change it down the line. If you want to change name, you will have to generate a new block verifier key pair and register yourself again. You will however lose your previous delegate stats.
{% endhint %}

First of all, the wallet service should be running in the background. Stop it by using the command: 

```text
systemctl stop XCASH_Wallet
```

Open and let synchronize your wallet generated during the node installation, either when using the [auto-installer](installation-process/#quick-installation) or [created manually](installation-process/#generate-a-wallet). 

```text
~/xcash-official/xcash-core/build/release/bin/xcash-wallet-cli --wallet-file ~/xcash-official/xcash-wallet/<WALLET_NAME>
```

Replace the `<WALLET_NAME>` with your own.

Once your wallet is fully synchronized, you can use the `delegate_register` command with the following parameters: 

```text
delegate_register <delegate_name> <IP_address|domain_name> <block_verifier_public_key>
```

And replace the information with:

* **`<delegate_name>`**: the name that will be displayed on the delegate explorer. Cannot be updated.
* **`<IP_address|domain_name>`** : your server's IP address or its domain name \(if you have bought a domain name and correctly set up the DNS record\). It is possible to change this information at a later time. Can be updated.
* **`<block_verifier_public_key>`** : the block verifier public key that you have generated [earlier](set-up-your-delegates.md#1-generate-a-block-verifier-key). Cannot be updated. 

**Example:**  

```text
delegate_register my_delegate my_delegate.domain.com cf8718d638ce0a831f3538ea60d1e27c3a258c7004a1ad7c547cc5331de7d9d7
```

You will be prompted to wait for the next valid data interval. Once your request has been accepted, you will receive the message `The delegate has been registered successfully`.

You can `exit` the wallet and restart the wallet service:

```text
systemctl start XCASH_Wallet
```

## 3. Update Your Delegate Information

Each registered delegates will be displayed in the [delegates explorer](http://delegates.xcash.foundation/), along with their statistics and information. At registration, the minimum information that is displayed is your **delegate name** and **IP address**. You can add additionnal instructions to help other identify you or rally to your cause and vote for you.

First of all, the wallet service should be running in the background. Stop it by using the command: 

```text
systemctl stop XCASH_Wallet
```

Open and let synchronize your wallet generated during the node installation, either when using the [auto-installer](installation-process/#quick-installation) or [created manually](installation-process/#generate-a-wallet). 

```text
~/xcash-official/xcash-core/build/release/bin/xcash-wallet-cli --wallet-file ~/xcash-official/xcash-wallet/<WALLET_NAME>
```

Replace the `<WALLET_NAME>` with your own.

Once your wallet is fully synchronized, you can use the `delegate_update` command with the following parameters: 

```text
delegate_update <item> <value>
```

Replace the `<item>` with one of the list below, and change the correspondig `<value>`

You will be prompted to wait for the next valid data interval. Once your request has been accepted, you will receive the message `The delegate info has been updated successfully`.
